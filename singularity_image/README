There is currently an issue changes in Matrix 1.6-2 that seem to have broken
irlba::irlba(). This results in the following error when a command such as
`quickCluster` is run:

Error in (function (A, nv = 5, nu = nv, maxit = 1000, work = nv + 7, reorth = TRUE,  :
                      function 'as_cholmod_sparse' not provided by package 'Matrix'

The workaround is to reinstall the irlba package. Hopefully this will be resolved in
future and the workaround will no longer be necessary.
